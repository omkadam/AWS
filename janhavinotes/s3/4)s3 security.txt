S3 SECURITY

How we can secure our s3 buckets?

There are diffrent components of s3 securities

1. User based

> So we have defined IAM users and we're going to attach IAM policies to them
to allow them to get access ofour s3 bucket

2. Resource based

> In this case we can define something new called bucket policy. which is going to 
be a rule attached directly into your s3 bucket to allow or deny requests comming from
other accounts or public request and so-on
. object access control list (OACL)
. bucket access control list (BACl)

When can an IAM permission access an s3 objects?

> it can access it if either the IAM permission attached to IAM principle
so the user or the group of the role can allow access the s3 bucket or if the s3
bucket policy allows it.

S3 BUCKET POLICIES

> JSON based policies
> use s3 bucket policy to:
    . Grant public access to the bucket
    . Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    . Grant access to another accounts
